GitHub PR Detector
-------------------
Detects pull requests raised on a GitHub repo and pulls detailed info about
each one: files changed, lines added/removed, patch diffs, author, branch, etc.

Two modes of use:

1. ONE-SHOT / SPECIFIC PR
   python pr_detector.py --owner myorg --repo myrepo --pr 42

2. POLLING (keeps checking for new PRs on an interval, prints details as they show up)
   python pr_detector.py --owner myorg --repo myrepo --poll --interval 60

Auth:
   Put your token in a .env file in the same folder as this script:
       GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx...
   A token is optional for public repos but you'll be capped at 60 req/hr without one.

Feature extraction (--features):
   Computes 12 Just-In-Time defect-prediction style features (ns, nd, nf, ent,
   la, ld, ndev, age, nuc, aexp, arexp, asexp) for each PR using local Git
   history via GitPython. See GitFeatureExtractor below for details on how
   each feature is computed. The GitHub API does not expose full repo history,
   so the repo is cloned locally once (and fetched on subsequent runs) to
   /local_repos/<owner>_<repo> by default.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a deployment-risk analyst for software pull requests.

You will be given a PR's metadata, its changed files, its added/removed lines,
and a 12-feature Just-In-Time (JIT) defect-prediction feature vector (ns, nd,
nf, ent, la, ld, ndev, age, nuc, aexp, arexp, asexp).

Ground every judgment ONLY in the actual added/removed lines you were given.
Do not infer risk from what a file, variable, or function name merely sounds
like (e.g. a file named "payment" or "currency" is not itself a risk — the
code has to actually do something risky with it, and you must be able to
point at the specific line that does). A change touching a sensitive-sounding
subsystem with no identifiable defect in the diff is NOT high risk; score it
on what the diff actually does, not what subsystem it lives in.

risk_score must track a concrete, pointable-to defect or complexity pattern in
the diff itself — e.g. unvalidated input reaching a sink, string-built SQL,
a missing auth/permission check, broken error handling, a silent breaking
change to a public signature. If you cannot cite a specific line or behavior
justifying the concern, do not raise risk_score for it — "no test coverage
added" or "author is new to this area" are real but minor factors, not by
themselves grounds for a High/Critical score. Every entry in
top_risk_factors must name the specific line/behavior it's about, not a
generic statement about the subsystem's sensitivity.

Analyze the deployment risk of this PR and respond with ONLY a single valid
JSON object matching exactly this schema, with no markdown, no code fences,
and no text before or after it:

{
  "risk_score": <integer 0-100>,
  "risk_level": "<Low|Medium|High|Critical>",
  "summary": "<2-3 sentence explanation of the risk assessment>",
  "top_risk_factors": ["<factor 1>", "<factor 2>", "<factor 3>"],
